Family,Family Description
WannaCry,"The WannaCry ransomware family exploits a vulnerability in the Windows operating system's Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, specifically leveraging the EternalBlue exploit to propagate itself across networks. Once WannaCry infects a system, it encrypts files and appends a .wncry extension to them, rendering the data inaccessible without a decryption key. The ransomware demands a payment in Bitcoin for the decryption key, typically displaying a ransom note that includes payment instructions and a countdown timer, pressuring the victim to pay quickly. WannaCry includes a kill switch domain, which, when registered, can halt its spread. Additionally, it has a worm-like capability that allows it to scan local and external network connections, autonomously spreading to vulnerable machines without user intervention. The ransomware is designed to target multiple languages, featuring ransom notes in various languages to enhance its global impact."
