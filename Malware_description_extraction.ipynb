            "The WannaCry ransomware family is characterized by its utilization of the EternalBlue exploit, a vulnerability in Microsoft's SMB protocol, allowing it to spread rapidly across networks without user interaction. Upon infection, WannaCry encrypts files on the affected systems using strong encryption algorithms, appending a specific extension to affected files. It then displays a ransom note demanding payment in Bitcoin to decrypt the files, giving users a deadline before permanently locking or deleting the files. Notably, WannaCry has a built-in \"kill switch\" domain check, which, when registered, can stop its propagation. This ransomware also attempts to spread to other systems on the same network and has a worm-like functionality, making it highly potent and damaging by affecting large numbers of computers in a short span of time. Security patches for the exploited SMB vulnerability and proper network segmentation are key countermeasures against its spread.\n"
